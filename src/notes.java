//- What is a Java method?

//Methods are a sequence of statements that perform a specific task.
//They are analogous to functions in JavaScript, and like JavaScript functions, they commonly accept input, and produce output.

//- Why use additional methods rather than writing all Java code in a main method?

//It makes the code more modular.
// Easier to test.
// Simpler to debug.

//- What does it mean to ‘call’ or ‘invoke’ a method?

//It causes the statements in a method to "run"

//When we define a method, we define parameters (inputs to the method), and when we call a function, we call it with arguments (the actual values passed to the method).
//Arguments can be literal values, variables, or themselves expressions that will be evaluated to a value that is passed to the method.
//Keep in mind that the data type of the arguments must be the same as the data type of the parameters that the method is defined with.




//What are six parts of a method definition as explained in the curriculum?

//visibility
//static/instance
//return type
//name of method
//parameters
//body


//In what ways do Java methods differ from JS functions?

//Syntax
//Methods tied to class or object in Java vs lone functions in JS
//default values require multiple methods vs syntax in a single function
//parameter data type is fixed vs flexible
//methods calls have to relate main method in Java bs no main method

//What is a method signature?

//method name + parameter list
//add(int x, int y)


//What is method overloading?

//Same name but accept different parameters

//ADD EXACT DEFINITION LATER


//Will changing the return type of a method overload it?
//TBD in later lesson


//What is recursion and what are the differences/pros/cons compared to iteration?



//What is a StackOverflowError?
